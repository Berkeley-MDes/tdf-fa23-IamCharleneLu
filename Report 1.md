# Report 1 - Week of 08/24/2023 
#### :mage::crystal_ball: Last week, I spent a huge amount of time to mastering the usage of the GitHub UI and Grasshopper. This was my first attempt at creating my own post on the platform. GitHub, to me, feels like a magical place where I can write code to create posts. I write some codes to generate a post.

> #### ðŸ’¡ My rout of learning how to use lasser cutter ####

+ I learned how to operate the machine, minimize the waste of material by adjusting my file, and test the intensity of Acrylic from Chris Parsell.

+ This is my result. I also cut a cute coaster for myself. The words "Charlene Lu's Coaster on the coaster" were my test of using RASTER cutting.

> #### :sparkles: My Reflection ####
+ Grasshopper is a great way for me to generate a 3D sketch in a project efficiently. I will keep working on this.
+ In this week, I was overwhelmed by all the homework from different courses. I am trying to figure out how to manage my time and be a productive person.

> #### :sparkles: Are there points in the process where you think AIâ€¦ ####
+ With the emerging black box AI platforms, design is becoming accessible and universal. As a designer with an industrial background, I emphasize user research and creativity. When it comes to originality, in my viewpoint, people using AI to generate a design project are like a designer and people using their own creativity to create a work are like artists.
