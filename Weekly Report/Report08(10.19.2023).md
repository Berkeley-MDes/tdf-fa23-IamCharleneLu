# Report 8 - Week of 10/19/2023 
### 🪐 Brief: This week is our presentation week for porject2! ###
> Musical Pillow: is a fun and inclusive music collaborative game that unleashes creativity through the unique blend of music and physical play. In this project, I was involved in every step, from brainstorming ideas and defining the project to prototyping and creating the final product.
# Reflection
In this project, I feel like I've made progress, but it may not be obvious. 😭 My team members are great at coding, while I faced challenges in that area. I'm familiar with design things – coming up with creative ideas, making prototypes, crafting 3D models, and producing videos. I even created a visual effect in TouchDesigner using data from Photon2, although we didn't end up using it. I found some simple music-making tutorials for MAX, but those ideas didn't make it into the final project. I hope to be able to complete a project like this on my own in the future. I've learned a lot from my group members. Rachel taught me the basics of coding, and Lingxiu is excellent at it. I'm thankful for the opportunity to work with them. I recognize the need to invest more time in learning how to write code!
Reflection from the peers in the Google Forms: After getting feedback from all my peers, I think it would be a good idea to narrow down how we create melodies to improve our project. It would be much more fun if we make this project even better. In terms of the 3D printed case, one of our team members suggested considering waterproofing, which I found to be a valuable suggestion. Regarding our presentation, I wish we could include more about the process leading up to the final prototype because it was quite a challenging journey.

> My contribution: Idea generation / sensor testing / music generation/ physical prototype
1. Brainstorming: Brainstorming process: At the beginning, our consensus was to facilitate people in creating music melodies. However, we struggled to find a good insight to design our project. We considered two approaches: one was to create useful musical creation kits for professional musicians, and the other was to create a fun, tangible music product for anyone. I researched various music products and found that there are many tools available for professional musicians nowadays, making it challenging to create a unique one. So, I suggested that my team choose to create a casual tangible product for everyone. I presented three ideas: pillow fighting, a modular icebreaker game, and a psychological test music collaboration. Our group unanimously agreed to develop the pillow-fighting music collaboration game.
2. Sensor Testing: Then, we started developing different types of sensors to create music. I used an ultrasonic sensor to produce visual effects in TouchDesigner. After a group discussion, we decided to use the ADXL362 to connect with Photon2, which Lingxiu tested.
3. Music Generation: In this process, we used MAX to generate melodies by collecting data in Python. Rachel and I faced challenges when inputting data into MAX, but thanks to Lingxiu, who helped us solve this problem. I found a different online tutorial and shared it with the team. Ultimately, Lingxiu created an electronic music-style music generator in MAX that can change chords, tones, and melodies when we interact with the fish pillow.
4. Physical Prototype: After finalizing all the necessary elements
for the Photon, I designed a 3D-printed case that can house a sensor, Photon2, and a battery. And I bought the cute fish pillows. This case can be placed inside the pillow, ensuring that the sensor remains stable and collects accurate data from people's movements.
5. Video Presentation: At the end, I laid out the project's steps, contents and goals. I made presentation slides and put together a video to show our cute and attractive design.
> My speculations on the future of this project
- Pillow Fighting has the potential to create unforgettable, inclusive experiences for all, blending physicality, creativity, and the joy of making music together. This project pushed the boundaries of engineering, compelling us to explore novel mechanisms and techniques that magically combine music and physical play. I imagine exciting possibilities for integrating AI into Pillow Fighting, offering new dimensions of sound manipulation and personalized gameplay experiences.
