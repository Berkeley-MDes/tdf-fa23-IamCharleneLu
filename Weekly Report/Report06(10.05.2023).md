# Report 6 - Week of 10/05/2023 
### 🪐 Brief: This week, we started our project2 ###
> my journey with my partners in project2
> 
At first, I was somewhat disappointed that I ended up in my last choice for our project group. However, after discussing our project following our class, I discovered that the field of music is fascinating and offers a lot of potential for learning. Sounds play a crucial role in our lives, and music, in particular, has the power to help us relax and strengthen connections within our community. During our discussion, we explored topics such as formal music education, musical instruments, and community engagement. While we had different ideas about the ways to interact, we all agreed on the technical aspects of our project.
