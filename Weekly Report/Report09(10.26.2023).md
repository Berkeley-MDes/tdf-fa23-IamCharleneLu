✨ During the past week, we brainstormed a variety of ideas for music collaboration. We narrowed our focus to two categories: professional music collaboration and casual music collaboration. Given our limited time and resources, we ultimately chose "Pillow Fighting" as our group project for music collaboration. Pillow Fighting is a delightful game that utilizes special pillows embedded with technology. When engaged in a pillow fight, these pillows produce fantastic sounds and melodies based on how you swing and move them. It's like turning a pillow fight into a musical adventure.

✨ For the core component, we decided to incorporate the "Adafruit MPU-6050 6-dof Accel and Gyro Sensor - Stemma qt Qwiic." This sensor is capable of capturing people's movements and can assist us in generating music based on people's gestures and movement speed.

✨ Moving forward, I will explore how to create visual effects to enhance the "Pillow Fighting" game experience.
