# Report 3 - Week of 09/14/2023 
### 💡☁️ Brief: This week, I made great progress by creating my own Cloud Lamp in Grasshopper. Thanks to TJ's tutorial last week, I gained a better grasp of 3D modeling logic in Grasshopper. Using this knowledge, I successfully designed and even 3D printed my lamp.

> #### 💭  My rout of creating COULD LAMP ####

+ Feeling the need for better lighting in my dimly lit room,  I decided to make my own table lamp. I ordered a G25 LED Globe Light Bulb and a lamp cord online. After examining the lighting kit, I realized that a shorter lamp wouldn't provide adequate coverage, so I chose to design a taller one, aiming for a height of approximately 15 millimeters.
+ In this project, I would like to create an adorable lamp with abstract designs. Drawing inspiration from dinosaurs' features and incorporating cloud imagery into my sketches, I hope this lamp will be a source of daily happiness for me.

> #### 💡 My rout of creating 3D model in Grasshopper ####
+ Step1: Start by establishing an XY plane and constructing two cylinders based on this plane
+ Step2: create an elevated XY plane and assemble three spheres together.
+ Step3: generate a new cylinder to create a hole that passes through one of the cylinders and one of the spheres
+ My Question!!! How can I create round corners all over the lamp?

> #### 👩‍💻 My Reflection ####

This week, I became more comfortable with Grasshopper, finding it easier to use. I'm eager to explore additional plugins in my free time, especially after Cody introduced us to the intriguing Kangaroo plugins last week. Cody's recent lecture was a highlight for me. His insights into real-world software applications were invaluable, and I found his work, such as the "Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center," incredibly inspiring due to its unique style.
