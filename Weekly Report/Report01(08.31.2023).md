# Report 3 - Week of 09/14/2023 
### 💡☁️ Brief: This week, I made great progress by creating my own Cloud Lamp in Grasshopper. Thanks to TJ's tutorial last week, I gained a better grasp of 3D modeling logic in Grasshopper. Using this knowledge, I successfully designed and even 3D printed my lamp.

> #### 💭  My rout of creating COULD LAMP ####

+ Feeling the need for better lighting in my dimly lit room,  I decided to make my own table lamp. I ordered a G25 LED Globe Light Bulb and a lamp cord online. After examining the lighting kit, I realized that a shorter lamp wouldn't provide adequate coverage, so I chose to design a taller one, aiming for a height of approximately 15 millimeters.
+ In this project, I would like to create an adorable lamp with abstract designs. Drawing inspiration from dinosaurs' features and incorporating cloud imagery into my sketches, I hope this lamp will be a source of daily happiness for me.

> #### 💡 My rout of creating 3D model in Grasshopper ####
+ Step01: I started with a cylinder and adjusted 'x' to make another cylinder right next to it.
+ Step02:  I made a plane with 'z' set at 100 and put three spheres in different spots.
+ Step03:  I mushed those three spheres together, like a combo.
+ Step04:  I combined everything - cylinders and spheres alike.
+ Step05:  To create a hole inside, I copied one of the cylinders, changed its size, and used this tool called "solid difference" to carve a hole from bottom to top. That's where the light and cables go.
+ Step06: I made a YZ plane and created two cylinders with different sizes along the X-axis to make a hole at the bottom.
+ Step07:  I merged those two cylinders together.
+ Step08:  I cleaned up underneath. I made this random object and used "solid difference" to take away stuff under the ground.

> #### 👩‍💻 My Reflection ####

This week, I became more comfortable with Grasshopper, finding it easier to use. I'm eager to explore additional plugins in my free time, especially after Cody introduced us to the intriguing Kangaroo plugins last week. Cody's recent lecture was a highlight for me. His insights into real-world software applications were invaluable, and I found his work, such as the "Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center," incredibly inspiring due to its unique style.
