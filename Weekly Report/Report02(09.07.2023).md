# Report 2 - Week of 09/07/2023 
### 🪴 Brief: This is my second time writing a GitHub report, and I'm starting to feel quite familiar with the GitHub user interface. This week, I put my efforts into learning Grasshopper.

## 💡 My mini vessel created in Grasshopper ##
I watched several instructional videos on the internet to learn how to create objects in Grasshopper. Following the steps outlined in one of the videos, I created my own mini vessel. I always want to make sure everything I create is useful, and this mini vessel will find its place as a decorative piece in my room.✨

> ### 💡 My rout of creating a vessel in Grasshopper ###
Following the steps outlined in one of the videos, I gained some insights.
+ The modeling process is divided into four main steps: points, lines, surfaces, and solids.
+ "Divide" typically refers to breaking up a curve or a line into smaller segments or components. 
+ "Loft" refers to a command or operation that creates a smooth, continuous surface between two or more curves or shapes.

+ I modified the setting to achieve my preferred form.

+ This is my first time using a 3D printer. Operating the Prusa MK3S+ is much easier than I anticipated. I only spent two hours printing this mini vessel, and the fact that it's free to use is just fantastic.🥳🥳🥳

> ### :sparkles: My Reflection ####
Last week, I was confused about using Grasshopper effectively. In my industrial design background, I usually used tools like Fusion 360 or ProE to create models, and Grasshopper's approach felt entirely different. At first, I thought of Grasshopper as a tool for making art rather than functional objects. But after making my mini vessel, I see Grasshopper as a fun and creative way to generate objects.🧚🏻‍♂️🔮🌟
