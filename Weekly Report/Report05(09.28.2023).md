# Report 5 - Week of 09/28/2023 
### **🪐 Brief: This week, I continue to have a curiosity about Photon and its capabilities. Consequently, I will document my recent Photon discoveries below. Additionally, it is imperative that we identify subjects of personal interest and delve deeper into them before Thursday. Therefore, I plan to conduct thorough research on the topics that intrigue me.** ###

>😶‍🌫️ what are different between photon and arduino?
- The Photon has built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, which make it easy to connect to the internet and other devices wirelessly. Most Arduino boards don't have built-in Wi-Fi or other wireless capabilities by default.
- Photon offers cloud services for managing and remotely interacting with Particle devices, making it convenient for IoT applications.
>🌟 Some interesting projects I searched onlin related to Photon helped me understand more about what Photon can do
- #### [Use the Force... Or your Brainwaves?](https://particle.hackster.io/Imetomi/use-the-force-or-your-brainwaves-9e839b#overview)
 **Description** : Thought controlled system with personal webserver and 3 working functions: robot controller, home automation and PC mouse controller. <br>
  **How does it work?** The Arduino Mega is the brain of the project that receives signals from the headset, analyzes then forwards commands to the other devices. Transmits every data forward to the Photon that creates the webserver. The Arduino Leonardo controls the mouse on a PC and the Uno is used to receive IR (infrared signals) and controls the robot.

- #### [Magic Eyeball](https://particle.hackster.io/pattvira/magic-eyeball-6832f9)
 **Description** : The creator use Alexa to control something tangible.  <br>
  **How does it work?** She built the frame to allow for the movement of the eyes and eyebrow, used a photon to control the motors to create different expressions and created an Alexa skill that communicates to the photon. 


>🌟 Takeaways from the last week class

In my undergraduate studies, our program primarily emphasized individual projects. Consequently, I gained limited experience working on school projects within a large group setting. However, in the MDes program, group projects are a big part of the curriculum, and this has allowed me to get more comfortable with working in teams. I've also discovered an interest in brainstorming with classmates who come from different backgrounds. It's amazing that I can learn from their experiences. This is an exciting chance for me to explore new opportunities and grow.
