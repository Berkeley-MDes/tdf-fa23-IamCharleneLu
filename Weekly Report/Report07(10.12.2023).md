# Report 7 - Week of 10/12/2023 
### ðŸª´ Brief: This is my second time writing a GitHub report, and I'm starting to feel quite familiar with the GitHub user interface. This week, I put my efforts into learning Grasshopper.

## ðŸ’¡ My mini vessel created in Grasshopper ##
I watched several instructional videos on the internet to learn how to create objects in Grasshopper. Following the steps outlined in one of the videos, I created my own mini vessel. I always want to make sure everything I create is useful, and this mini vessel will find its place as a decorative piece in my room.âœ¨
