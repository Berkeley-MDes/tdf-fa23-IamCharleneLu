# Report 4 - Week of 09/21/2023 
### üí°‚òÅÔ∏è Brief ###
This week, my focus was on familiarizing myself with the Particle Photon2. I gained an understanding of the fundamental procedures for operating the Particle Photon2. Additionally, I acquired knowledge on writing programs, connecting input devices and sensors to my Photon2, reading data from these devices through a program, and connecting LEDs and motors.
