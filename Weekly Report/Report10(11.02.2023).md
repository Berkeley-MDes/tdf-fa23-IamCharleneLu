# Report 10 - Week of 11/02/2023 
### 🪐 Brief: This week, we had presentation. ###
> My Refelction in this project 
> 
✨ I am pleased to have received positive feedback from Sudhu and my peers. Sudhu suggested an idea about emojis. Since not everyone can understand emojis, it would be beneficial if the language model could also explain them in words. In addition to the project, Sudhu recommended that we record our voices with our heads covered by cloth to achieve higher quality voice recordings.

✨ I believe this technology can change our emotional connection with tech. A digital friend, like Ichi, understands our emotions, preferences, and needs. It's designed to bring out positive emotions and support our personal growth. I see this technology becoming more tailored. It will focus on understanding individual user needs and preferences, leading to customized designs.
