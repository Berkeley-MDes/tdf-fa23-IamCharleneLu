# Report 10 - Week of 11/02/2023 
### 🪐 Brief: This week, we had presentation and lecture ###
> My Refelction in this project 
> 
✨ I am pleased to have received positive feedback from Sudhu and my peers. Sudhu suggested an idea about emojis. Since not everyone can understand emojis, it would be beneficial if the language model could also explain them in words. In addition to the project, Sudhu recommended that we record our voices with our heads covered by cloth to achieve higher quality voice recordings.

✨ I believe this technology can change our emotional connection with tech. A digital friend, like Ichi, understands our emotions, preferences, and needs. It's designed to bring out positive emotions and support our personal growth. I see this technology becoming more tailored. It will focus on understanding individual user needs and preferences, leading to customized designs.

> About the lecture from MOHIT BHOITE

🤖 I am thoroughly impressed with all the projects created by Mohit Bhoite. He is not just an expert in engineering but also incredibly creative. In this lecture, I saw many of his imaginative works. I learned that engineering components can be aesthetically installed in a box. One project that I found particularly impressive is the LED Sand Animation. It combines an LED matrix display with a three-axis accelerometer to create an interactive sand grain animation. I think this could be an intriguing addition to my previous project on pillow fighting, adding cool visual effects to the game.
