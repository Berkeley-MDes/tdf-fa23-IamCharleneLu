> About the lecture from MOHIT BHOITE

🤖 I am thoroughly impressed with all the projects created by Mohit Bhoite. He is not just an expert in engineering but also incredibly creative. In this lecture, I saw many of his imaginative works. I learned that engineering components can be aesthetically installed in a box. One project that I found particularly impressive is the LED Sand Animation. It combines an LED matrix display with a three-axis accelerometer to create an interactive sand grain animation. I think this could be an intriguing addition to my previous project on pillow fighting, adding cool visual effects to the game.
