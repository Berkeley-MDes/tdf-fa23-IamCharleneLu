# Report 1 - Week of 08/24/2023 
#### :mage::crystal_ball: Last week, I spent a huge amount of time to mastering the usage of the GitHub UI and Grasshopper. This was my first attempt at creating my own post on the platform. GitHub, to me, feels like a magical place where I can write code to create posts. I write some codes to generate a post.

> #### 💡 My rout of learning how to use lasser cutter ####

+ With Chris Parsell's guidance, I learned to use the machine, reduce material waste through file adjustments, and test Acrylic intensity.

+ This is what I accomplished, and as a bonus, I made an adorable coaster for myself. I tried out RASTER cutting by engraving the words "Charlene Lu's Coaster on the coaster."

> #### :sparkles: My Reflection ####
+ Grasshopper is a great way for me to generate a 3D sketch in a project efficiently. I will keep working on this.
+ In this week, I was overwhelmed by all the homework from different courses.😵‍💫 I am trying to figure out how to manage my time and be a productive person.💫

> #### :sparkles: Are there points in the process where you think AI… ####
+ With the emerging black box AI platforms, design is becoming accessible and universal. With my background in industrial design, I think using AI for design makes people designers due to evolving AI tech. I also compare this to people relying on personal creativity, who I see as artists. This shows how tech changes creativity, but human artistry stays special even as AI enhances our abilities.
