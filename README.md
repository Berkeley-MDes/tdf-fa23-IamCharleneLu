# Report 7 - Week of 10/12/2023 
### ü™ê Brief: This week, we are working on our project2 ###
> my journey with my partners in project2
> 
‚ú® During the past week, we brainstormed a variety of ideas for music collaboration. We narrowed our focus to two categories: professional music collaboration and casual music collaboration. Given our limited time and resources, we ultimately chose "Pillow Fighting" as our group project for music collaboration. Pillow Fighting is a delightful game that utilizes special pillows embedded with technology. When engaged in a pillow fight, these pillows produce fantastic sounds and melodies based on how you swing and move them. It's like turning a pillow fight into a musical adventure.

‚ú® Moving forward, I will explore how to create visual effects to enhance the "Pillow Fighting" game experience.

# Report 6 - Week of 10/05/2023 
### ü™ê Brief: This week, we started our project2 ###
> my journey with my partners in project2
> 
At first, I was somewhat disappointed that I ended up in my last choice for our project group. However, after discussing our project following our class, I discovered that the field of music is fascinating and offers a lot of potential for learning. Sounds play a crucial role in our lives, and music, in particular, has the power to help us relax and strengthen connections within our community. During our discussion, we explored topics such as formal music education, musical instruments, and community engagement. While we had different ideas about the ways to interact, we all agreed on the technical aspects of our project.

# Report 5 - Week of 09/28/2023 
### **ü™ê Brief: This week, I continue to have a curiosity about Photon and its capabilities. Consequently, I will document my recent Photon discoveries below. Additionally, it is imperative that we identify subjects of personal interest and delve deeper into them before Thursday. Therefore, I plan to conduct thorough research on the topics that intrigue me.** ###

>üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è what are different between photon and arduino?
- The Photon has built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, which make it easy to connect to the internet and other devices wirelessly. Most Arduino boards don't have built-in Wi-Fi or other wireless capabilities by default.
- Photon offers cloud services for managing and remotely interacting with Particle devices, making it convenient for IoT applications.
>üåü Some interesting projects I searched onlin related to Photon helped me understand more about what Photon can do
- #### [Use the Force... Or your Brainwaves?](https://particle.hackster.io/Imetomi/use-the-force-or-your-brainwaves-9e839b#overview)
 **Description** : Thought controlled system with personal webserver and 3 working functions: robot controller, home automation and PC mouse controller. <br>
  **How does it work?** The Arduino Mega is the brain of the project that receives signals from the headset, analyzes then forwards commands to the other devices. Transmits every data forward to the Photon that creates the webserver. The Arduino Leonardo controls the mouse on a PC and the Uno is used to receive IR (infrared signals) and controls the robot.

- #### [Magic Eyeball](https://particle.hackster.io/pattvira/magic-eyeball-6832f9)
 **Description** : The creator use Alexa to control something tangible.  <br>
  **How does it work?** She built the frame to allow for the movement of the eyes and eyebrow, used a photon to control the motors to create different expressions and created an Alexa skill that communicates to the photon. 


>üåü Takeaways from the last week class

In my undergraduate studies, our program primarily emphasized individual projects. Consequently, I gained limited experience working on school projects within a large group setting. However, in the MDes program, group projects are a big part of the curriculum, and this has allowed me to get more comfortable with working in teams. I've also discovered an interest in brainstorming with classmates who come from different backgrounds. It's amazing that I can learn from their experiences. This is an exciting chance for me to explore new opportunities and grow. 

# Report 4 - Week of 09/21/2023 
### üí°‚òÅÔ∏è Brief ###
This week, my focus was on familiarizing myself with the Particle Photon2. I gained an understanding of the fundamental procedures for operating the Particle Photon2. Additionally, I acquired knowledge on writing programs, connecting input devices and sensors to my Photon2, reading data from these devices through a program, and connecting LEDs and motors.

# Report 3 - Week of 09/14/2023 
### üí°‚òÅÔ∏è Brief: This week, I made great progress by creating my own Cloud Lamp in Grasshopper. Thanks to TJ's tutorial last week, I gained a better grasp of 3D modeling logic in Grasshopper. Using this knowledge, I successfully designed and even 3D printed my lamp.

> #### üí≠ My rout of creating COULD LAMP ####

+ Feeling the need for better lighting in my dimly lit room,  I decided to make my own table lamp. I ordered a G25 LED Globe Light Bulb and a lamp cord online. After examining the lighting kit, I realized that a shorter lamp wouldn't provide adequate coverage, so I chose to design a taller one, aiming for a height of approximately 15 millimeters.
+ In this project, I would like to create an adorable lamp with abstract designs. Drawing inspiration from dinosaurs' features and incorporating cloud imagery into my sketches, I hope this lamp will be a source of daily happiness for me.

> #### üí° My rout of creating 3D model in Grasshopper ####
+ Step01: I started with a cylinder and adjusted 'x' to make another cylinder right next to it.
+ Step02:  I made a plane with 'z' set at 100 and put three spheres in different spots.
+ Step03:  I mushed those three spheres together, like a combo.
+ Step04:  I combined everything - cylinders and spheres alike.
+ Step05:  To create a hole inside, I copied one of the cylinders, changed its size, and used this tool called "solid difference" to carve a hole from bottom to top. That's where the light and cables go.
+ ‚ö†Ô∏è I noticed a super useful function. When I hit that green and white icon, I can get a really clear look at my 3D model. It's super helpful for seeing the whole thing.
  
  <img width="1200" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-IamCharleneLu/blob/main/image/Report03_003.png">
+ Step06: I made a YZ plane and created two cylinders with different sizes along the X-axis to make a hole at the bottom.
+ Step07:  I merged those two cylinders together.
+ Step08:  I cleaned up underneath. I made this random object and used "solid difference" to take away stuff under the ground.
+ I used sand paper to remove the supporter whithin this lamp.

> #### üë©‚Äçüíª My Reflection ####

This week, I became more comfortable with Grasshopper, finding it easier to use. I'm eager to explore additional plugins in my free time, especially after Cody introduced us to the intriguing Kangaroo plugins last week. Cody's recent lecture was a highlight for me. His insights into real-world software applications were invaluable, and I found his work, such as the "Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center," incredibly inspiring due to its unique style.



# Report 2 - Week of 09/07/2023 

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è Brief: This is my second time writing a GitHub report, and I'm starting to feel quite familiar with the GitHub user interface. This week, I put my efforts into learning Grasshopper. ###

### ü™¥ My mini vessel created in Grasshopper ###
I watched several instructional videos on the internet to learn how to create objects in Grasshopper. Following the steps outlined in one of the videos, I created my own mini vessel. I always want to make sure everything I create is useful, and this mini vessel will find its place as a decorative piece in my room.‚ú®

> ### üí° My rout of creating a vessel in Grasshopper ###
Following the steps outlined in one of the videos, I gained some insights.
+ The modeling process is divided into four main steps: points, lines, surfaces, and solids.
+ "Divide" typically refers to breaking up a curve or a line into smaller segments or components. 
+ "Loft" refers to a command or operation that creates a smooth, continuous surface between two or more curves or shapes.
<img width="1200" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-IamCharleneLu/blob/main/image/report02_003.png">

+ I modified the setting to achieve my preferred form.

> ### :sparkles: My Reflection ####
Last week, I was confused about using Grasshopper effectively. In my industrial design background, I usually used tools like Fusion 360 or ProE to create models, and Grasshopper's approach felt entirely different. At first, I thought of Grasshopper as a tool for making art rather than functional objects. But after making my mini vessel, I see Grasshopper as a fun and creative way to generate objects.üßöüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîÆüåü






# Report 1 - Week of 08/24/2023 
#### :mage::crystal_ball: Last week, I spent a huge amount of time to mastering the usage of the GitHub UI and Grasshopper. This was my first attempt at creating my own post on the platform. GitHub, to me, feels like a magical place where I can write code to create posts. I write some codes to generate a post.

> #### üí° My rout of learning how to use lasser cutter ####

+ With Chris Parsell's guidance, I learned to use the machine, reduce material waste through file adjustments, and test Acrylic intensity.
<img width="1200" alt="how to operate the lasser cutter" src="https://github.com/IamCharleneLu/documents./blob/README.md/Ming-Chen(Charlene)%20Lu_Project%200.png">

+ This is what I accomplished, and as a bonus, I made an adorable coaster for myself. I tried out RASTER cutting by engraving the words "Charlene Lu's Coaster on the coaster."

> #### :sparkles: My Reflection ####
+ Grasshopper is a great way for me to generate a 3D sketch in a project efficiently. I will keep working on this.
+ In this week, I was overwhelmed by all the homework from different courses.üòµ‚Äçüí´ I am trying to figure out how to manage my time and be a productive person.üí´

> #### :sparkles: Are there points in the process where you think AI‚Ä¶ ####
+ With the emerging black box AI platforms, design is becoming accessible and universal. With my background in industrial design, I think using AI for design makes people designers due to evolving AI tech. I also compare this to people relying on personal creativity, who I see as artists. This shows how tech changes creativity, but human artistry stays special even as AI enhances our abilities.
