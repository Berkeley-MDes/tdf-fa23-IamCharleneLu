# Report 2 - Week of 09/07/2023 
#### ☁️ This is my second time writing a GitHub report, and I'm starting to feel quite familiar with the GitHub user interface. This week, I put my efforts into learning Grasshopper.

## 🪴 My mini vessel created in Grasshopper ##
I watched several instructional videos on the internet to learn how to create objects in Grasshopper. Following the steps outlined in one of the videos, I created my own mini vessel. I always want to make sure everything I create is useful, and this mini vessel will find its place as a decorative piece in my room.✨

> ### 💡 My rout of creating a vessel in Grasshopper ###
Following the steps outlined in one of the videos, I gained some insights.
+ The modeling process is divided into four main steps: points, lines, surfaces, and solids.
+ "Divide" typically refers to breaking up a curve or a line into smaller segments or components. 
+ "Loft" refers to a command or operation that creates a smooth, continuous surface between two or more curves or shapes.

+ I modified the setting to achieve my preferred form.

+ This is my first time using a 3D printer. Operating the Prusa MK3S+ is much easier than I anticipated. I only spent two hours printing this mini vessel, and the fact that it's free to use is just fantastic.🥳🥳🥳

> ### :sparkles: My Reflection ####
Last week, I was confused about using Grasshopper effectively. In my industrial design background, I usually used tools like Fusion 360 or ProE to create models, and Grasshopper's approach felt entirely different. At first, I thought of Grasshopper as a tool for making art rather than functional objects. But after making my mini vessel, I see Grasshopper as a fun and creative way to generate objects.🧚🏻‍♂️🔮🌟






# Report 1 - Week of 08/24/2023 
#### :mage::crystal_ball: Last week, I spent a huge amount of time to mastering the usage of the GitHub UI and Grasshopper. This was my first attempt at creating my own post on the platform. GitHub, to me, feels like a magical place where I can write code to create posts. I write some codes to generate a post.

> #### 💡 My rout of learning how to use lasser cutter ####

+ With Chris Parsell's guidance, I learned to use the machine, reduce material waste through file adjustments, and test Acrylic intensity.

+ This is what I accomplished, and as a bonus, I made an adorable coaster for myself. I tried out RASTER cutting by engraving the words "Charlene Lu's Coaster on the coaster."

> #### :sparkles: My Reflection ####
+ Grasshopper is a great way for me to generate a 3D sketch in a project efficiently. I will keep working on this.
+ In this week, I was overwhelmed by all the homework from different courses.😵‍💫 I am trying to figure out how to manage my time and be a productive person.💫

> #### :sparkles: Are there points in the process where you think AI… ####
+ With the emerging black box AI platforms, design is becoming accessible and universal. With my background in industrial design, I think using AI for design makes people designers due to evolving AI tech. I also compare this to people relying on personal creativity, who I see as artists. This shows how tech changes creativity, but human artistry stays special even as AI enhances our abilities.
